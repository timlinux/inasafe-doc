"In the previous example, we classified the :guilabel:`vegetasi` layer by "
"what is known as nominal classification. This type of classification is when"
" categories are defined based on names. Next we will classify the "
":guilabel:`pemukiman` layer based on the size of each feature. Classifying "
"with attributes that contain only positive numbers, such as land area, is "
"known as ratio classification."
