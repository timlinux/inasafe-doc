"A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a system designed to enable people "
"to work with data related to places on the Earth. A GIS allows the creation,"
" storage, manipulation and analysis of geographic data. GIS is a very broad "

" this unit we will learn how to use the excellent open-source application, "
